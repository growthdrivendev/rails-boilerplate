# The Rails boilerplate by Growth Driven Development

This boilerplate was created to speed up the process of learning how to create a Ruby on Rails apps during the courses posted on the [http://gddev.org](http://gddev.org) education platform.

## Project configuration

The only thing you have to do before start working with this boilerplate is to change the application name. In order to do this, you can use the `./configure.sh` shell script which accepts the new application name as the argument. So, if your application should be named `Guestbook` then call the shell script this way:

```
./configure.sh Guestbook
```

it will update the `config/application.rb` file and the application layout.

## Configuration

If you need configuration variables in your app you can create `app.yml` config file:

```
cp config/app.yml.example config/app.yml
```

From now on you can define entries in the `app.yml` file and then use them like this:

```ruby
YourAppName.config['key_name']
```

## Available commands

If you want to quickly re-create the development environment you can call the following command:

```
bundle exec rake app:reset
```

It will drop the development and test databases, create them again, run migrations, load test db data (if available) and prepare test database.
