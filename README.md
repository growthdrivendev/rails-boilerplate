# The Rails boilerplate by Growth Driven Development

This boilerplate was created to speed up the process of learning how to create a Ruby on Rails apps during the courses posted on the [http://gddev.org](http://gddev.org) education platform.

## Project configuration

The only thing you have to do before start working with this boilerplate is to change the application name. In order to do this, you can use the `./configure.sh` shell script which accepts the new application name as the argument. So, if your application should be named `Guestbook` then call the shell script this way:

```
./configure.sh Guestbook
```

it will update the `config/application.rb` file and the application layout.
